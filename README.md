# Calculator-collection
dists is the folder with the runnable files for 3 different calculators, 
one calculates an amount of numbers from the Fibonacci Sequence, the other 
2 are a normal calculator(CalculatorGUI) and the other one that also 
calculates with fractions. Even though it doesn't calculate with a GUI
it is more error proof and I personally think is easier to use.
